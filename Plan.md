# Plans for the app's development

## Libraries
* Tailwind CSS (for faster CSS development)
* React Router? (for the settings page)
* Framer Motion (animations)
* Ant Design (UI)
* Ant Icons
* Redux (for password options)

## Features
The same as before, but maybe add:
* Remove password from generated ones
* Regenerate password using last parameters, even if the new ones are changed

# password-generator

## Description
This is a website that generates random passwords based on parameters set by the user. I built this website mainly to practice, since this is the first time I'm building a website where you can do stuff like change the color theme and the language.
I also made it because I think it can be useful to some people, even though you'll find the same stuff in your password manager.

## Features
You can generate up to 99 passwords at a time with a maximum length of 150 characters. It's also possible to include or exclude uppercase/lowercase characters, numbers, symbols, and add separators (like an hyphen) every 5 characters. I'm planning to add more advanced features to customize your passwords, like choosing the separator character.
In the settings you can choose what sections to show or hide, such as the footer, the language and the default values for the "Quantity" and "Length" inputs.

## How to use
Just go on the website (you can find the link in the "About" section of the repository) and check out the features! :D

## Technologies
I used HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript to build this website. For the icons I used FontAwesome, and the animations are all built with normal CSS.
